> **"When We Teach, Two Learn"**  

Known as the **Prot√©g√© Effect**, research shows that teaching others strengthens our own understanding.  
**Protege** flips traditional learning by challenging users to explain concepts to dynamic AI personas: forcing deeper thinking, clearer communication, and true mastery.

## Features

- üß† **Dynamic Persona Teaching:** Explain topics to AI personas like a curious child, a seasoned professor, or a historical figure.
- ‚ùì **Adaptive Follow-up Questions:** Personas challenge users with real-time, personalized questions to deepen understanding.
- üé≠ **Animated Interaction States:** Smooth transitions between idle and speaking animations for an immersive experience.
- üìù **Immediate Feedback & Scoring:** Receive clarity scores and actionable feedback after each session.
- ‚ö° **Powered by Gemini Live API:** Real-time, streaming interactions that feel fluid, responsive, and human-like.
