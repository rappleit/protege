# Protege AI Agent Personas Documentation

## What are the AI Agent Personas?

Protege's AI agents are decentralized, interactive student characters hosted on the DAIN network.  
Each agent embodies a unique persona — such as a curious child, a Viking warrior, or a scholar — designed to simulate authentic, emotionally engaging teaching experiences.

Agents:
- Listen to the user's explanations.
- React emotionally (excitement, confusion, boredom).
- Ask follow-up questions.
- Evaluate teaching quality across multiple dimensions.
- Award badges to encourage effective teaching styles.

## Input to the AI Agent

For every teaching moment, the agent receives:

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `sessionId` | Unique ID for the ongoing lesson (topic + persona). |
| `explanation` | User's text-based explanation. |
| `imageBase64` | (Optional) Whiteboard drawing provided as a base64-encoded string. |
| `inputType` | Mode of input: `"text"`, `"speech"`, `"text+drawing"`, `"speech+drawing"`, etc. |
| `timestamp` | UTC timestamp of when the teaching moment was submitted. |

## Output from the AI Agent

The agent processes the input and responds with:

| Field | Description |
